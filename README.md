# fr0g Protocol 🐸

**Anonymous, serverless and uncensorable temporary file archive on Stellar Testnet.**

A small open-source experiment to upload files completely anonymously and make them publicly (or privately) accessible directly on the Stellar Testnet blockchain — no servers, no accounts, no tracking.
### Ribbit — Official Browser Client

The simplest and nicest way to use fr0g:

→ **[Open Ribbit](https://0ut0flin3.github.io/fr0g-protocol/frontend/index.html)**


### ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **Testnet only**: files are temporary (Stellar Testnet is periodically reset)
- Not permanent storage
- Educational and creative experiment
- Do not use for sensitive or important data

### What You Can Do Today

- Upload any file (images, videos, websites, code, documents…)
- Get an anonymous **fr0g ID** in one click
- Make the file visible in the public Discover feed
- Everything runs **100% client-side** (no backend)
- Impossible to censor while Testnet is live
- Completely free

### Creative Use Cases (the coolest ones)

fr0g shines for anonymous and temporary projects. Here are real examples people are already doing:

#### 1. One-File HTML Websites / Ghost Micro-Sites
Upload a single `index.html` (with inline CSS & JS) and get a full website accessible worldwide just by sharing the fr0g ID.

**Real examples:**
- Anonymous portfolio
- Political / artistic manifesto
- Temporary personal diary
- Cyberpunk or glitch landing page
- “My site that will disappear in a few weeks”

#### 2. One-File Mini-Games
Publish complete small games in a single HTML5 file.

**Real examples:**
- Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe, minimal Flappy Bird
- Short visual novels
- Interactive experiments
- “Play my anonymous game before it vanishes”

#### 3. Anonymous Art Drops
Artists releasing work without identity:
- Generative art
- Pixel art
- Glitch art
- Connected image series via fr0g IDs

#### 4. Anonymous Poetry & Writing Drops
Poems, short stories, anonymous letters, haiku, experimental texts.

#### 5. Secret Dead Drops
Privately share the fr0g ID as an uncensorable digital dead-drop mailbox.

#### 6. Chain Storytelling
Collective stories written anonymously, chapter by chapter.
